sigh (in);
ehm (pause);
jss..very peaceful ();





euuh;
(long pause);
well I- guess- uh- I would be-
how I would be- as if it were;





ouuuo (silent- ecxited);
euhh dark probably- eeehm;

aaand--- uh--
empty- uhm- euh-

if I weren't- I dunno- I always associate that sort of idea with
being in a coffin so..that's very much...being somewhere so I don't know.
-uuuuhm- 
eh-
pro-bab-- ly quite relaxing ..really-
 - not so stressful as - as if I were.
(long, long pause);

I dunno.
(long pause);
candle blowin' out- sort of THing. 
I dunno- sort of- maybe I'd smoke a bit. (laugh)



if I wasn't----if I wasn't alive-is that what it means?
(small pause)
WELL I know I'd be in heaven- and I'd be with Robert
and with RObert's mom and Robert's dad 
and MY mom and my dad....and with all my uncles and aunts-so I'd be very happy.
So....so I think I would get a sense of fullfillment. 



A-lass (unintelligble)-obviously impossible question - 
I can only think of it in contents (contexts?) in kind of like...(pause) mm-
never having been- rather than weren't, 
or maybe cea-ceasing to be but obviously that's because... (pause) 
my concept of being- is- is in parallel to...being alive- I guess- which is- is- starts with birth and ends with death. 
So I can only think of not - not being - in context- yeah ...

having never been OR ceasing to be (pause) so thass how I'm interpreting it 
ehm- I dunno how it would be... if I weren't. EHm....
(pause)
So I guess also if I'm construing it that way it's like either that - I've never- like what would it be if I'd never been or like, if I ceased to be- and I can only think of that in context of -like- other people...and other people's reactions.. I guess...

So I dunno what it would be like for ME if I weren't because I wouldn't be
- so- it wouldn't be anything for me. 






I don't think there'd be a comparative - would there?
'cuz that was something that I used to think about when I was a child ..aannd just trying to imagine the absence of anything and...you know, you need presence, no absence- surely. so if you were not- how would have a qualitative feel? You know...How would you even understand that absence in YOUR own absence? 
There would be no qualitative feel of no sentience (unintelligible), surely-
so- what would it be LIKE? 
There would be no like, if I was not. I wouldn't....
If I was not, I just wouldn't -
I suppose.... (laugh) that's it. 






(super long pause);
--a knock----

"THAT is my queue"



uhm
(long pause) (sigh)
Well I guess up until...26 years ago...everything would be EXACTLY the same.
- Since that point, for...99.9..9..9 (and) a couple o'more places of the world, life would be Exactly the same.
Ehm...
For a few people very close to me...say (pause) my mom, my dad- - - they might have just had another kid, shortly afterwards aaand I dunno if life would be very different for them either.
(pause)
THAT's the traditional way of looking at it, but if you take a kind of modest view of it, which I sort of do- i think- 
if I weren't
there would be nothing ....that...
I mean..
All this..is just kind of made by me... You know. (sigh)
You don't (pause) uhm
The nature of kind of substance and matter is so kind of...(pause) 
nonsensical and paradoxical and just sort of, mixed up and part of everything else that.. 
the only thing that make things into things- all the delineation and stuff- all comes from--me in the first place. 
(big sigh)
So if I weren't then (long pause) there would be nothing.






laugh- Ooooooh- well, I am!
That's almost a ***darecap christian** you know...
I think therefore I am! 




Like what!
(giggle)
I don't think you're being very specific here- you haven't finished the question! (laugh)
If I weren't...well I think I can't really conceive of that because - I am! ...something
(quick pause)
But I have an idea! I have quite a strong idea...
but it's a personal experience like- I think it's....uuh..
pointless at describing because..
ehm....by attempting to describe it..uhm- it would just defeat the point 
(pause)
That's all I can say.




(long pause)
-sings a little tune-
what would it be like if I- weren't?
(long pause)
wooommmp-
(long pause)-
hmmmm----
(pause)
what it would it be like I weren't?

(long pause)

I have no idea.

(long pause)

It reminds me of..uhm....aww..what's that film with dustin hoffman? Aaauuuh... film with dustin hoffman aaaaand the other lady (pause) ehm and there's a question in it - it's like- how am I not myself? How am I not myself?

It reminds me of that.

Wait- what was the question again?

Pascal: What would it be like if you weren't?

What would it be like if I weren't?

(giggle)
(pause)

I have no idea mate.

-whispers- what would it be like if I weren't?

(long pause)

no idea.
